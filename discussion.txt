In this notebook we manually create a 2D convolution operation and then we compare it against pytorch's convolution operation
The conv_pytorch function performs a 2D convolution using pytorch
The conv_numpy_1 function performs a 2D convolution manually with just one channel in and one channel out
We then test out convolution implementation against pytorch's
conv_numpy_2 is similar to conv_numpy_1 but adds strides which allow us to adjust the input size
conv_numpy_3 is similar to conv_numpy_2 but with multiple input and output channels
conv_numpy_4 performs a manual 2d convolution on multiple images

In this notebook we go over the upscaling and downscaling operations on images
subsampling reduces an image by choosing one value within a nxn mask and creating a new image that's smaller than the original one
maxpooling is a subsampling technique that chooses the max value within the nxn mask to create the new image
meanpooling is similar to maxpooling, but uses the mean of all the values within the mask to come up with the new image
duplicating is an upscaling method that takes a value from an image an expands it to create a mask of copies of the same of size nxn
maxunpooling uses the max of a set of values to create the upscaled mask
